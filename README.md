### Factors that go into our algo
* Type of virus (incubation period, infectivity before show of symptoms, airborne survival duration, mode of transmission)
* Time spent together
* Size of room/nature of activities in the room (manual adding of weights)
* Average density of people in the room (better solution cos its derived)

### Features
* Enter a confirmed case and search backwards for people to quarantine (assign a confidence score)
* Be able to select which organisations to include in the search
* Follow up on suspected cases, alerting admin to call them up when symptoms should arise, otherwise mark as cleared
* Demonstrate the impact of issuing quarantine orders faster (drop in a quarantine point)
* Flag up locations that should be sanitized
